Drop the ball
Author: Tiffany Dufu

This book is Tiffany Dufu's memoir detailing her struggles to "have it all". Gloria Steinem's foreword is what drew me to the book. 

>There are two ways that a system of power stays in power. The first is obvious - unequal laws, unequal opportunity, very unequal money and viloence of threat of violence - but the second is more internal and difficult to uproot. It's the idea of what is normal; how we ourselves behave to earn equality and power, and how early in our lives these norms are introduced. Since women are half of every population, and unlike other secondary groups, not only live and work with men but give birth to boys as well as girls, there is a constant danger that we will recognize our shared humanity and rebel. That's why gender roles have to begin so early and go so deep. Those are the inequalities we grow up with, from a pink or blue blanket to the invention of "masculine" and "feminine". We see these roles all around us, assume they are invevitable, and come to expect conformity even of ourselves.

>When a belief punishes the believer - for instance when women believe that for us, "having it all" must mean "doing it all" - it becomes what psychologists call *internalized oppression*

Dufu's book is an attempt to make us, the readers aware of our own internalized oppresion and describe strategies to get past it. Dufu uses her own life as an example of how a woman can go from an unequal family dynamic to a more democratic one.

Many parts of the book resonated with me very much. In many places even incidents seemed completely taken from my life - Dufu trying to express milk in a bathroom stall, imaginary delegation, feeling frustrated at not being able to have a martha stewart-esque order in the house while also trying to be a great employee at work - these seemed like my own stories 

> The myth of the ideally supported worker and the expectations of extreme parenting conspire to communicate a clear message to a new generation of women: you can have it all, as long as you do it all. Sooner or later, we discover that doing it all is impossible

While the most common sense solutions like paid family leave, national affordable child care etc require legistations, Dufu describes what she calls 2 options women typically choose from 
>
- Dropping out of career pursuits altogether, affluent women especially
- "Mommy track" - reduced work hours, taking advantage of flex policies - all of which carry the stigma of noncommitment to work. Even though of late the more politically correct term is "non-linear track"

On women being "deeply anxious" about home

> Many women experience a second of pressure that men rarely do - the pressure to succeed at work _and_ to keep things running smoothly at home, especially when children arrive on the scene...In addition to fulfilling our professional responsibilities, we feel are in charge of the home front...No matter what we achieve in our careers, if our home lives aren't taken care of, we experience it as a moral failure

On mothers feeling more personally accountable compared to fathers
> As long as hour husbands are doing relatively more than their peer group or what our society seems to expect of them, then we're happy they've done their fair share. This inequitable division of labor has psychological repurcussions: when men chagne a diaper, we feel like they're helping us out; when we change a diaper, we feel like we're just doing our job

On "Imaginary Delegation"
>There are many ways to ask for help with household responsibilities, but the key is that we _do_ have to ask. My problem was that I had fallen into a trap of _imaginary delegation_. This is when we mentally assign our partners a task but never take the step of telling them. We assume they will intuit our needs or that they'll naturally step forward if we hang back.

On Home Control Disease (HCD)
> Most modern women scoff at the idea that a woman's place is in the home. And yet, many women still focus obsessively on everything about it - how it's organized, how it's managed and how the cooking, cleaning and caretaking gets done, right down to the smallest detail. Only one brand of detergent will do. Only organic, 1 percent milk. When it comes to our homes, many women feel a compulsive need to control, to make sure everythign is managed in a particular way - our way. I call this Home Control Disease
> 
> ...It's fueled in part by a reluctance to abdicate responsibility in the one place female authority is unquestioned

Lone Ranger Syndrome
>At work, the Lone Ranger Syndrome comes from women's faith in false meritocracy. In school, we are largely rewarded based on our academic performance. We put our heads down, work hard, and achieve great results. Our education is largely a solo endeavor, and individual hard work and persistence pays off. But at work, being a Lone Ranger causes us to focus more on our output and less on cultivating the relationships that are just as critical to our career advancement. We go it alone expecting to be recognized based on our own merits, without asking the right stakeholders to advocate for us.
>
>At home, the Lone Ranger Syndrome comes from women's faith in false efficiency. We believe that whatever we can do better and faster, we should do it ourselves. The problem is that we believe we can do everything faster and better, so everything ends up on our list. 

On what matters most
> Some of that noise is imposed upon us: all the cultural messages telling us what _should_ matter to us. But it's critical that we take the time and space to discover what _does_ matter most for ourselves.

How she identified her own overarching purpose, what matters most to her

- **Funeral visualization** (from Stephen Covey's _The 7 Habits of Hightly Effective People_). Imagine a family member eulogize you....was inspired to live up to these imagined testaments

- **Reflected Best Self Exercise** - solicit stories from people that know you from different stages of life. Window into the strengths and qualities that had greatest impact on others

Law of Comparative Advantage
>Focus our attention on the areas we bring the most _value_ as managers, instead of on the areas where might be better than others because of experience alone....I should be looking at my to-do list with an eye to the obligations I _couldn't_ delegate. The most powerful outcome of the comparative advantage approach was that it shrank my to-do list dramatically

> Once we know what _we_ need to focus on in order to be successful, we are better positioned to determine what _other_ people need to do to better support us

Drop the ball
> Expecting less of ourselves and more from our partners, requiring that we not only release a task to the other person, but we also resist doing it ourselves, even when it doesn't get done...it is not a static one time occurrence, the details evolve over time

Other ideas

- Codify who does what
- Recruit a village

On affirmations
> We all need to be our own champions. I have coached many women to create their own self-affirmations, phrases that reinformce positive truths about themselves...
> 
> Such self-affirmations gives women the permission we sometimes need to prioritize our own success. It is one thing to Drop the Ball because our life-go-rounds have made us so dizzy; it is another to Drop the Ball because we know that we're worthy of a full night's sleep
> 
> ..When we are positively affirmed by ourselves and others, we feel _deserving_ of the support that's required for us to excel. When we recognize our value, we don't hesitate to solicit help from others; we are about to recognize the upside of collaboration, not just for ourselves but also for the other person
> 
> Gratitude is particularly powerful form of affirmation - grease for the "All In Partnership"

On All In Partnerships
> If women truly want men to step up at home, we have to start seeing them not as dumb, useless or selfish, but as intelligent, capable and generous agents of change in our lives. When we do this, we increase the likelihood they'll measure up as husbands, fathers and human beings. We also ignite our own possibilities. On the other hand, our perpetuation of the dumb-dad myth stifles everyone's potential.

On maternal gatekeeping
> The more a mother believes the father to be incompetent, the more gatekeeping she does. The more gatekeeping she does, the less practice he gets fulfilling parental responsibilities. The less competent a father is, the less motivated he is to spend time with his children.
 
Happiness hurdles and strategies to overcome them

- **Incessant feeling of culpability** - Stop feeling guilty. Need to usher in the post-apology era
- **Tendency to dishonour our boundaries** - "if we don't respect our time, how can we expect others to?"
- **Lack of happiness habits** - "stop and sit"

Conclusion
> Before someone else can take the reins, women have to release them first

> There is a parable that describes a woman who is swimming across a lake, and near the center, she begins to get tired and sink. People watching from the shore cry out to her, "Drop the rock!" but she initially doesn't understand them. She regains her momentum and swims a few strokes but again tires and struggles to stay afloat. Finally, she notices what the onlookers have seen. There is a rock tied aroudn her, pulling her down. To the people on the shore, the answer to her dilemma seems so obvious: drop the rock! But as see sinks, they can hear her saying, "I can't. It's mine"
